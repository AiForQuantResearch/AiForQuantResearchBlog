This paper, developed by **AiQR Academy**, provides a rigorous and structured introduction to **linear regression methods**, which form a cornerstone of statistical modeling, machine learning, and quantitative finance.

It begins with a formal presentation of **linear regression**, establishing the mathematical framework linking a continuous target variable to a set of explanatory features. The paper then introduces the **Least Mean Squares (LMS)** algorithm and thoroughly derives its optimization via **gradient descent**, including batch, stochastic, and mini-batch variants.

An analytical solution is presented through the **normal equations**, offering a closed-form alternative to iterative optimization methods. The paper also develops a **probabilistic interpretation** of linear regression, showing that parameter estimation can be viewed as a maximum likelihood problem under the assumption of Gaussian errors.

A dedicated section discusses the **statistical assumptions** underlying linear regression—linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of errors, and absence of multicollinearity—which are critical for ensuring reliable estimation and inference.

The paper then introduces **regularization techniques**, namely Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net, explaining how shrinkage helps control overfitting, improve numerical stability, and perform feature selection in high-dimensional settings. It concludes with a concise overview of **essential matrix derivatives**, which are fundamental tools for deriving and understanding linear and regularized models.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide **strong theoretical foundations**, serving as a necessary stepping stone toward more advanced and nonlinear machine learning models used in modern quantitative finance.
